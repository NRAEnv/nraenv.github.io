<h1>Q*cert</h1>

This site hosts the (prettified) source code for the Q*cert certified query
compiler.  Q*cert is built and verified using the Coq proof
assistant. A working compiler can be obtained by 'extracting' OCaml
code from the source in Coq.

The source documentation (generated using coqdoc) can be found <b><a
href="https://nraenv.github.io/doc/">here</a></b>.  Note that this is a
large project, and not all of it is described in our paper submission.
